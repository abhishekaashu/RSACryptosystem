# RSACryptosystem

This project implements the RSA encryption and decryption algorithms using BigInteger class in java and using basic theoretical concepts too. The concepts used to build this project are Miller-Rabin test for primality,

It also implements the Discrete Logarithm in Diffie-Hellman Protocol using Baby-step Giant-step algorithm.
Also, Miller-Rabin test is used as a test for primality in this code.
