# Cryptosuite

This project implements the RSA encryption and decryption algorithms. It also implements the Discrete Logarithm using Baby-step Giant-step algorithm. Also, Miller-Rabin test is used as a test for primality in this code.

It was developed during the CS101 (Computer Programming in C++) introductory course at IIT Bombay.

## Getting Started

Just clone the repository and compile & execute [main.cpp](src/main.cpp). No prerequisite software/tools needed.
